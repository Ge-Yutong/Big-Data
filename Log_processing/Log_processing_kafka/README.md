The task at hand is to develop a big data pipeline to process and analyze a log file in real <me. The pipeline starts with feeding the data into a KaDa producer, which will publish the data to a KaDa topic. A KaDa consumer, subscribed to the same topic, periodically checks for new data. Once the data is available, Spark is used to perform transforma<ons and conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the received data.
