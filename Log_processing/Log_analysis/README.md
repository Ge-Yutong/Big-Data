This is the implementation of two tasks in the NASA Log Analytics case study. In the first task (3.1), the goal was to find the most accessed endpoint each day of the week. Multiple approaches were explored, including grouping and aggregation, join tables, and window functions. The filter method with window functions was found to be the most efficient.

In the second task (3.2), the objective was to group the data by year and count the occurrences of the 404 status. However, all the records in the dataset were from the year 1995, preventing the retrieval of data for 10 different years.
