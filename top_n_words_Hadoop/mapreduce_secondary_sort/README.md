This method outlines the steps to implement a MapReduce program for finding the top N words based on their frequency in a dataset. It involves creating a custom writable class, using a mapper to filter and emit word-frequency pairs, a reducer with a PriorityQueue to maintain the top N words, and a combiner to aggregate frequencies. The secondary sort ensures the final output is sorted by frequency and then alphabetically by word.
